  ## DESCRIPTION:
Inspired by Matchbox 20, we plan to use this app to write our readme, git it, commit it, and push it (around) to github.
  ## LANGUAGES USED:
 JavaScript , HTML , ES6 
  ## INSTALLATION:
Installation of this application best starts by finding superior products, of a similar function, and using them instead. If you are unlucky enough to have only found this one, please clone this repository to your computer, install node (google is your friend), open the terminal in VS Code (not installed? Google is your friend), navigate to the folder you cloned and write node index. Answer the prompts, and you're good to go.
