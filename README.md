  ## Description: 
Brought to you by the makers of ADD Interpreted, now that we've given you ample hours of killing time Oggling, Boggling, Joggling and Toggling we felt it was time to give back to the community. In this application, our goal is to save time (and theoretical money). Desgined for the developer who couldn't find a better Read Me Generator than this one, we're giving you an opportunity to quickly and easilt create a Read Me for your GitHub project.
  ## Languages: 
JavaScript, ES6
  ## Installation: 
Clone this repository to the folder of your choice, then open the folder in VS Code. Make sure to have Node installed, open your terminal and type "node index" (Pro tip, don't actually type " "). This will run through a series of questions until you have finished, and drop your new Read Me in the dist(ribution) folder.
